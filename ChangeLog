    threads. GitHub issue #385 and follow up issue #390.

  - Fix compilation with Visual Studio in C++17 mode. GitHub issue #401.

  - Allow disabling implicit initialization through `configure` script option
    `--disable-implicit-initialization`, or CMake build option
    `LOG4CPLUS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_INITIALIZATION`. (MaksymB)

  - Remove `android` directory with obsolete Android support. GitHub
    issue #283.

  - Link with `libatomic` when necessary. (Fabrice Fontaine)


# log4cplus 2.0.3

  - Fix compilation on systems without `O_CLOEXEC`. This affects, e.g.,
    Solaris 10. GitHub issue #326. (Patch by Jiangrz).

  - Provide `log4cplus::deinitialize()` to make the API symmetric
    (`log4cplus::initialize()` already exists) and to allow
    de-/initialization without `log4cplus::Initializer` instance. GitHub
    issue #340.

  - Deal with `register` keyword being generated in SWIG based bindings. The
    keyword is unused and reserved in C++17. Remove use of
    `std::unary_function`, it was removed in C++17.

    API. (Jens Rehsack)

  - Add `NDCMatchFilter` and `MDCMatchFilter`. (Franck)


# log4cplus 2.0.2

    `setThreadPoolSize()`. Allow setting the size from `log4cplus.properties`
    using `log4cplus.threadPoolSize` property. Lower initial thread pool size
    by half to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` threads. GitHub issue
    #315.

  - Fix Autotools based build for MinGW. GitHub issue #317.

  - Add `configure` script option `--enable-lto` to allow easier LTO builds.

  - Optimization of `getFormattedTime()`. (Alexey Vishtak)

  - Introduction of `LOG4CPLUS_MACRO_FILE()` used in logging macros to allow
    users to redefine it and consequently hide source file names from their
    compiled executables and logging output.


# log4cplus 2.0.1

  - Update to Automake 1.16.1.

  - Adjust `spi::LoggerFactory` to allow custom `spi::LoggerImpl`. GitHub
    issue #309.

  - Fix MacOS X compilation. GitHub issue #312.


# log4cplus 2.0

  - CMake improvements: Automate export of includes if building as Cmake
    sub-module. (Rodion Malinovsky)

  - Debian spec file improvements: Use parallel build. Fix installation path
    on 64bit. (Michal Marek)

  - CMake improvements: Use `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}` instead of hardcoding
    lib. (Radek Dostál)

  - Experimental Windows 10 ARM support through CMAKE


# log4cplus 2.0-RC2

  - Avoid copying whole message just to prepend message length in
    `SocketAppender`. Instead, use OS specific "gather" socket write.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #136.

  - `FileAppender` classes now have `TextMode` property that can be set to
    `Binary` or `Text` (default) to specify underlying IO stream behavior
    with respect to end-of-line handling. (Patch by raphaelmarcucci).

  - Fixed compilation issues when building log4cplus with Visual Studio and
    Clang toolchain.

  - Fixed various shutdown and initialization related deadlocks and
    crashes. GitHub issues #251, #253.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #243. Single-threaded build with Visual Studio and
    CMake were not single-threaded.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #250. Creating WiX based installer using CPack does
    not work because of missing license file.


# log4cplus 2.0-RC1

  - **IMPORTANT**: Implementation language is now C++11. OS specific
    implementations have been replaced by C++11 facilities wherever
    possible. This lowers complexity of the library and improves
    maintainability but it also brings limitations to when the library can be
    used. Specifically, the library should not be used before `main()` is
    entered and after `main()` is left. Even more specifically, the library
    should not be used during global objects construction and destruction.

  - log4cplus uses Catch unit testing framework and has unit tests.

  - log4cplus supports IPv6.

  - Autotools based build system is now partially generated from templates by
    the Autogen tool.

  - Autotools based build system can build both `wchar_t` and plain `char`
    variants at once.
