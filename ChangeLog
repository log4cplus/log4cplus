# log4cplus 2.0-RC2

  - Avoid copying whole message just to prepend message length in
    `SocketAppender`. Instead, use OS specific "gather" socket write.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #136.

  - `FileAppender` classes now have `TextMode` property that can be set to
    `Binary` or `Text` (default) to specify underlying IO stream behavior
    with respect to end-of-line handling. (Patch by raphaelmarcucci).

  - Fixed compilation issues when building log4cplus with Visual Studio and
    Clang toolchain.

  - Fixed various shutdown and initialization related deadlocks and
    crashes. GitHub issues #251, #253.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #243. Single-threaded build with Visual Studio and
    CMake were not single-threaded.

  - Fixed GitHub issue #250. Creating WiX based installer using CPack does
    not work because of missing license file.


# log4cplus 2.0-RC1

  - **IMPORTANT**: Implementation language is now C++11. OS specific
    implementations have been replaced by C++11 facilities wherever
    possible. This lowers complexity of the library and improves
    maintainability but it also brings limitations to when the library can be
    used. Specifically, the library should not be used before `main()` is
    entered and after `main()` is left. Even more specifically, the library
    should not be used during global objects construction and destruction.

  - log4cplus uses Catch unit testing framework and has unit tests.

  - log4cplus supports IPv6.

  - Autotools based build system is now partially generated from templates by
    the Autogen tool.

  - Autotools based build system can build both `wchar_t` and plain `char`
    variants at once.
