  any other -O.

- Improved logging speed using SysLogAppender and Log4jUdpAppender by
  optimizations in both the loggers and in common sockets code.

  Locale property. See FileAppender Doxygen documentation for more
  details.

  are macros. (Chernyshev Vyacheslav)

- Enabled SysLogAppender on Windows with only remote syslog logging
  enabled.


log4cplus 1.1.0-RC7

IMPORTANT: Builds with --with-iconv configure switch now assume UTF-8
           for plain char strings.

- Bumped up SO version for UDP sockets support related changes.

- Removed Windows CE support.

- Regenerated with Automake 1.12.2.

  short (/Zc:wchar_t-) (Windows).

- Added new appender CLFSAppender (experimental), based on Microsoft
  Common Log File System API.

  GetSystemTimeAsFileTime().

  available for all appenders.

- Changed Windows configuration to use __declspec(thread) when
  compiling for Windows Vista or later and TlsAlloc() otherwise.

- Implemented %r PatternLayout format specifier - miliseconds since
  process start.

- Fixed bug #3101459 - TTCCLayout time is not in milliseconds since
  process start by default.

  project (Andreas Bießmann).

- Updated various Autoconf detection scripts in m4/ directory to newer
  versions.

- Fixed some signedness and overflow warnings.

  functions. Implemented SharedObject reference counting using C++11
  atomics where possible.

- Added inter-process file locking to file appenders to allow logging
  into a single log file from multiple processes.

- Added Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) and associated converter (%X).

- Added alternative thread identification (%T) converter to pattern layout.

- Added function name converter (%M).

- Added wchar_t <-> char conversion implementations based on standard
  C locale functions and based on iconv().
