% log4cplus README

Short Description
=================

log4cplus is a simple to use C++ logging API providing thread-safe,
flexible, and arbitrarily granular control over log management and
configuration.  It is modeled after the Java log4j API.

Configure script options
========================

`--enable-debugging`
--------------------

This option is disabled by default.  This option mainly affects GCC
builds but it also has some limited effect on non-GCC builds.  It
turns on debugging information generation, undefines `NDEBUG` symbol
and adds `-fstack-check` (GCC).


`--enable-warnings`
-------------------

This option is enabled by default.  It adds platform / compiler
dependent warning options to compiler command line.


`--enable-so-version`
---------------------

This option is enabled by default.  It enables SO version decoration
on resulting library file, e.g., the `.2.0.0` in
`liblog4cplus-1.2.so.2.0.0`.


`--enable-release-version`
--------------------------

This option is enabled by default.  It enables release version
decoration on the resulting library file, e.g., the `-1.2` in
`liblog4cplus-1.2.so.2.0.0`.


`--enable-symbols-visibility-options`
-------------------------------------

This option is enabled by default.  It enables use of compiler and
platform specific option for symbols visibility.  See also the
[Visibility](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility) page on GCC Wiki.


`--enable-profiling`
--------------------

This option is disabled by default.  This option adds profiling
information generation compiler option `-pg` to GCC and Sun CC /
Solaris Studio builds.


`--enable-threads`
------------------

This option is enabled by default.  It turns on detection of necessary
compiler and linker flags that enable POSIX threading support.

While this detection usually works well, some platforms still need
help with configuration by supplying additional flags to the configure
script.  One of the know deficiencies is Solaris Studio on Linux.  See
one of the later note for details.


`--with-working-locale`
-----------------------

This is one of three locale and `wchar_t` <-> `char` conversion
related options.  It is disabled by default.

It is know to work well with GCC on Linux.  Other platforms generally
have lesser locale support in their implementations of the C++
standard library.  It is known not to work well on any BSDs.

See also docs/unicode.txt.


`--with-working-c-locale`
-------------------------

This is second of `wchar_t` <-> `char` conversion related options.  It
is disabled by default.

It is known to work well on most Unix--like platforms, including
recent Cygwin.


`--with-iconv`
--------------

This is third of `wchar_t` <-> `char` conversion related options.  It is
disabled by default.

The conversion using iconv() function always uses `"UTF-8"` and
`"WCHAR_T"` as source/target encoding.  It is known to work well on
platforms with GNU iconv.  Different implementations of `iconv()`
might not support `"WCHAR_T"` encoding selector.

Either system provided `iconv()` or library provided `libiconv()` are
detected and accepted.  Also both SUSv3 and GNU `iconv()` function
signatures are accepted.


`--with-qt`
-----------

This option is disabled by default.  It enables compilation of a
separate shared library (liblog4cplusqt4debugappender) that implements
`Qt4DebugAppender`.  It requires Qt4 and pkg-config to be installed.


Notes
=====

Cygwin/MinGW
------------

Some version of GCC (3.4.x and probably some of 4.x series too) on
Windows (both Mingw and Cygwin) produces lots of warnings of the form:

> warning: inline function 'void foo()' is declared as dllimport:
  attribute ignored

This can be worked around by adding `-Wno-attributes` option to GCC
command.  Unfortunately, not all affected version of GCC have this
option.


MinGW and MSVCRT version
------------------------

log4cplus can use functions like `_vsnprintf_s()` (Microsoft's secure
version of `vsnprintf()`). MinGW tool--chains (by default) link to the
system MSVCRT.DLL. Unfortunately, older systems, like Windows XP, ship
with MSVCRT.DLL that lacks these functions. It is possible to compile
log4cplus with MinGW tool--chains but _without_ using the Microsoft's
secure functions by defining `__MSVCRT_VERSION__` to value less than
`0x900` and vice versa.

    $ ../configure CPPFLAGS="-D__MSVCRT_VERSION__=0x700"


Windows and TLS
---------------

log4cplus uses thread-local storage (TLS) for NDC, MDC and to optimize
use of some temporary objects.  On Windows there are two ways to get
TLS:

(1) using `TlsAlloc()`, etc., functions
(2) using `__declspec(thread)`

While method (2) generates faster code, it has some limitations prior
to Windows Vista.  If log4cplus.dll is loaded at run time using
`LoadLibrary()` (or as a dependency of such loaded library), then
accessing `__declspec(thread)` variables can cause general protection
fault (GPF) errors.  This is because Windows prior to Windows Vista do
not extend the TLS for libraries loaded at run time using
LoadLibrary().  To allow using the best available method, log4cplus
enables the method (2) by checking `_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0600` condition,
when compiling log4cplus targeted to Windows Vista or later.


Threads and signals
-------------------

log4cplus is not safe to be used from asynchronous signals' handlers.
This is a property of most threaded programmes in general.  If you are
going to use log4cplus in threaded application and if you want to use
log4cplus from signal handlers then your only option is to block
signals in all threads but one that will handle all signals.  On POSIX
platforms, this is possible using the `sigwait()` call.  log4cplus
enables this approach by blocking all signals in any threads created
through its threads helpers.


IBM's XL C/C++ compiler
-----------------------

IBM's XL C/C++ compiler executable has [many variants][1].  To compile
log4cplus with threading support specify one of the compiler variants
that support threading using the `CXX` variable on configure script
command line.  E.g.:

    $ ../configure --enable-threads CXX=xlC_r

[1]: http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v121v141/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp121.aix.doc%2Fcompiler_ref%2Ftucmpinv.html


AIX reentrancy problem
----------------------

There appears to be a reentracy problem with AIX 5.3 and xlC 8 which
can result into a deadlock condition in some circumstances.  It is
unknown whether the problem manifests with other versions of either
the OS or the compiler, too.  The problem was initially reported in a
bug report [#103][2].

The core of the problem is that IBM's/xlC's standard C++ IOStreams
implementation uses global non recursive lock to protect some of its
state.  The application in the bug report was trying to do logging
using log4cplus from inside `overflow()` member function of a class
derived from `std::streambuf` class.  log4cplus itself uses
`std::ostringstream`.  This resulted into an attempt to recursively
lock the global non recursive lock and a deadlock.

Solaris / SunOS
---------------

Some older version of this operating system might have problems
linking log4cplus due to [missing `__tls_get_addr`][3] in their
unpatched state.

Solaris Studio
--------------

Solaris Studio compilers' default standard C++ library is very
non-standard.  It seems that it is not conforming enough in, e.g., Sun
C++ 5.12 Linux_i386 2011/11/16 (missing `std::time_t`, etc.), but it
works well enough on Solaris with Sun C++ 5.8 2005/10/13.  Thus
log4cplus adds `-library=stlport4` to the `CXXFLAGS` environment
variable, unless a switch matching `-library=(stlport4|stdcxx4|Cstd)`
is already present there.  If you want to override the default
supplied by log4cplus, just set it into `CXXFLAGS` on configure script
command line.

Solaris Studio supports the `__func__` symbol which can be used by
log4cplus to record function name in logged events.  To enable this
feature, add `-features=extensions` switch to `CXXFLAGS` for configure
script.  Subsequently, you will have to add this switch to your
application's build flags as well.


Solaris Studio on GNU/Linux
---------------------------

The autotools and our configure.ac combo does not handle Solaris
Studio compiler on Linux well enough and needs a little help with
configuration of POSIX threads:

    $ COMMON_FLAGS="-L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ \
    -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -mt=yes -O"

    $ ../configure --enable-threads=yes \
    CC=/opt/solarisstudio12.3/bin/cc \
    CXX=/opt/solarisstudio12.3/bin/CC \
    CFLAGS="$COMMON_FLAGS" \
    CXXFLAGS="$COMMON_FLAGS" \
    LDFLAGS="-lpthread"


HP-UX with aCC
--------------

It is necessary to turn on C++98 mode of aCC by providing the `-AA` flag:

    $ ../configure --enable-threads=yes CXXFLAGS="-AA"


HP-UX with `aCC` on IA64
------------------------

There is a problem on I64 HP-UX with `aCC` (HP C/aC++ B3910B
A.06.20). The problem manifests as
[unsatisfied symbols during linking of `loggingserver`][9]:

    ld: Unsatisfied symbol "virtual table of loggingserver::ClientThread" in file loggingserver.o

The problem appears to be a deficiency in `aCC` and its support of
`__declspec(dllexport)`. To work around this issue, add
`--disable-symbols-visibility-options` to `configure` script command
line:

    $ ../configure --disable-symbols-visibility-options \
    --enable-threads=yes CXXFLAGS="-AA"

Haiku
-----

Haiku is supported with GCC 4+. The default GCC version in Haiku is
set to version 2 (based on GCC 2.95.x). To change the default GCC
version to version 4, please run `setgcc gcc4` command. This is to
avoid linking errors like this:

~~~~
main.cpp:(.text.startup+0x54a): undefined reference to `_Unwind_Resume'
~~~~

Running the command switches the _current_ GCC version to version 4.
This change is permanent and global. See also Haiku ticket
[#8368](http://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/8368).


Qt4 / Win32 / MSVC
------------------

In order to use log4cplus in Qt4 programs it is necessary to set
following option: `Treat WChar_t As Built in Type: No (/Zc:wchar_t-)`

Set this option for log4cplus project and `Qt4DebugAppender` project
in MS Visual Studio.  Remember to use Unicode versions of log4cplus
libraries with Qt.  It is also necessary to make clear distinction
between debug and release builds of Qt project and log4cplus.  Do not
use log4cplus release library with debug version of Qt program or vice
versa.

For registering Qt4DebugAppender library at runtime, call this
function: `log4cplus::Qt4DebugAppender::registerAppender()`

Add these lines to qmake project file for using log4cplus and
`Qt4DebugAppender`:

    INCLUDEPATH += C:\log4cplus\include
    win32 {
        CONFIG(debug, debug|release) {
            LIBS += -LC:\log4cplus\msvc10\Win32\bin.Debug_Unicode -llog4cplusUD
            LIBS += -LC:\log4cplus\msvc10\Win32\bin.Debug_Unicode -llog4cplus-Qt4DebugAppender
        } else {
            LIBS += -LC:\log4cplus\msvc10\Win32\bin.Release_Unicode -llog4cplusU
            LIBS += -LC:\log4cplus\msvc10\Win32\bin.Release_Unicode -llog4cplus-Qt4DebugAppender
        }
    }


`LOG4CPLUS_*_FMT()` and UNICODE
-------------------------------

Beware, the `%s` specifier does not work the same way on Unix--like
platforms as it does on Windows with Visual Studio. With Visual Studio
the `%s` specifier changes its meaning conveniently by printing
`wchar_t` string when used with `wprintf()` and `char` strings when
used with `printf()`.  On the other hand, Unix--like platforms keeps
the meaning of printing `char` strings when used with both `wprintf()`
and `printf()`.  It is necessary to use `%ls` (C99) specifier or `%S`
(SUSv2) specifier to print `wchar_t` strings on Unix--like platforms.

The common ground for both platforms appears to be use of `%ls` and
`wchar_t` string to print strings with unmodified formatting string
argument on both Unix--like platforms and Windows. The conversion of
`wchar_t` back to `char` then depends on C locale.


C++11 support
-------------

log4cplus contains small amount of code that uses C++11 (ISO/IEC
14882:2011 standard) language features.  C++11 features are used only
if C++11 support is detected during compile time.  Compiling log4cplus
with C++11 compiler and standard library and using it with C++03
(ISO/IEC 14882:2003 standard) application is not supported.


Unsupported compilers
---------------------

log4cplus does not support too old or broken C++ compilers:

- Visual C++ prior to 7.1
- GCC prior to 3.2
- Older versions of Borland/CodeGear/Embarcadero C++ compilers


Unsupported platforms
---------------------

log4cplus requires some minimal set of C and/or C++ library
functions. Some systems/platforms fail to provide these functions and
thus log4cplus cannot be supported there:

- Windows CE - missing implementations of `<time.h>` functions
